        "content": "  你在北方的寒夜里，四季如春  我在南方的艳阳里，大雪纷飞  如果天黑之前来得及，我要忘了你的眼睛  穷极一生，做不完一场梦2016年马上就要过去了，这个博客是我在今年小学期期间自己摸索着做的，竟也顺利存活了 (●’◡’●)。下面先放一下这四个多月来博客的数据：  页面总访问量 71,160 次  独立用户数 7,226 人  分享经济学人杂志 20 期  收到 Donation 计 310+ 元上面两张分别是博客访问者的分布图。颜色越深、圆圈越大代表访客数越多。本想做个 Donation List 的，但好多用微信转的，微信出于隐私考虑，没有显示转账人的任何信息。TE我是进大学开始后才接触的 TE，刚开始是因为对经济学感兴趣，所以会偶偶打印几篇英文的文章看看。由于单词量不够，又有点强迫症，看到陌生的单词都要查一下，所以那时看的既心累，又很慢。再加上，作为一名理科生我有点抵触英语。后来我慢慢地发现，人之所以会反感学一样东西，常常是因为两个原因 —— 要么就是你真的对它不感兴趣，要么就是你不擅长。对学英语，这两项我都占了。:disappointed_relieved:后来看了一本英文原版的『富兰克林自传』，18世纪的英语加上纷杂的语法花了我半年才陆陆续续啃完。接着又看了几本英文的书，像『Animal Farm』, 『River Town』,『Driving China』，之后对英语就不反感了。开始学了一些经济金融方面的专业知识后，再去看 TE 上相关的文章就好些了。开始理解经济学人每年发布一次的大汉堡指数 (Big Mac index) 原来就是基于购买力平价 (PPP) 理论的。真正说喜欢上英语，那是连续看了一年的 TE 之后。那时每周最期待的事就是等新的 TE 出版，然后去打印店打印个二三十页感兴趣的看。放假把看完的 TE 带回家，发现都有十几厘米厚了。之前看英文杂志看的比较杂，除了经济学人外，也看 FT, WSJ, Time, Newyorker, Newsweek, HBR，总之就是各种杂志都想去了解下，看看它们各自的风格和立场。现在英文的杂志我基本上只看 TE，每周还是打印 20-30 页看，中文的喜欢看金融时报中文网上的文章。FT 在工作日每天更新十几篇文章，我一般在吃饭的时候挑感兴趣的看。这一年这一年，发生了经历了一些事，有得有失，有喜有悲，不过总的来看，成长了不少。      看了几本杂书。最开心的是把很早就想看的几本『剑桥中国史』看了下。上次去人文学院听哈佛大学费正清中国研究中心现任主任宋怡明 (Michael A.Szonyi) 教授的讲座，我问他宋史什么时候能出，他看起来很高兴地回答：“马上会出版。” 不过，等翻译成中文就不知道是猴年马月了。        听了一些讲座。除了经院的，其他院有感兴趣的也会去。        听了些艺术学院的音乐会。印象最深的是德沃夏克的 b 小调大提琴协奏曲。(Youtube 上下了个视频，如果感兴趣可以看下。)        学了几个月 R 语言。学的时候觉得 R 好强，有好多支持包可以直接调用，听说还可以用到高大上的量化投资上去。好久没碰了，现在忘的差不多了。  前端小学期开始接触的网页制作，具体是因为什么原因开始的，我也不记得了。学 R 的时候知道了 Github（老师的上课课件和代码就放上面）这个全球著名的开源代码托管平台。这个博客我是用静态博客生成器 Jekyll 做的，托管在 Github Pages 上。刚开始学的时候遇到了好多坑，一个接一个，一开始用百度，慢慢地往后就只能靠英文 Google 和 StackOverflow 了。在这过程中让我觉得很温暖的一点是，如果我尝试了其他人博客里的教程还是没成功的话，我给他们发的邮件，他们基本上都会回复，这是让我觉得互联网超 Nice 的地方。现在大家看到的首页飘雪的动画，是我前几天从 TinyPNG 这个网站学来的。美中不足的一点是，我发现它在  火狐浏览器 (Firefox) 上失效，我就试着给它们发了封邮件说明了情况，两天后就收到了回复。刚看了下，他们已经修复了这个火狐上的小 bug。并且很严谨地在代码里写道：弄完这个博客，我初步了解了 html, css, javascript，从 Github 上学到了一些东西。9月开学后，开始捣鼓  Linux 系统，各种发行版都学着装了一遍后发现还是 Manjaro Linux 最优雅， openSUSE KDE 最好用。一个多月前买了阿里云的虚拟主机和域名，倒腾了另一个著名的博客系统 WordPress，还有图床。弄完发现遇到瓶颈了，玩不下去了。来年      看杂书。“生命太短，普鲁斯特太长。” 最想看完的是普鲁斯特的七部意识流小说『追忆似水年华』。        听讲座、音乐会。        学 Python、LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)。既然前端已遇瓶颈，那就换个思路，学点 Python，曲线救国。听闻当年小扎就是用这些鼓捣出 FB 的前身 Facemash 来帮助哈佛男生撩妹的。:joy:  最后最后，就是。。。冬至，冬至，好吃不过饺子！:sweat_smile:",

        "content": "\t11月9日，北京大学国家发展研究院将举行林毅夫和张维迎就产业政策的公开辩论。自8月底，张维迎和林毅夫就产业政策爆发论战，张维迎呼吁废除一切形式的产业政策，林毅夫则认为在经济发展过程中“有为的政府”必不可缺。China’s industrial policyPlan v marketNov 5th 2016 | SHANGHAI | Print EditionIT IS not quite Keynes-Hayek, but Lin-Zhang is a marvel in its own right. Perhaps the most famous debate in the history of economics was that between John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek—a clash over the benefits and perils of government intervention that exploded in the 1930s and still reverberates today. It has echoed around Chinese lecture halls in recent months. Justin Lin, a former chief economist of the World Bank, who leans to Keynesian faith in public spending, has squared off against Zhang Weiying, a self-professed Hayekian who doubts bureaucrats can ever beat the free market.Like their predecessors, Mr Lin and Mr Zhang have been sparring over two decades. And whereas Keynes and Hayek were down the road from each other (respectively, in Cambridge and London), the Chinese professors are now only a few paces apart, both at the prestigious Peking University. Their latest debate has been one of their fiercest, becoming a talking point for the domestic press, other academics and even officials.At issue is one of the big questions facing China’s economy: does industrial policy work? The idea that the government can champion specific industries is central to Chinese policy. Officials have long favoured different sectors, from textiles in the 1980s to renewable energy this decade. China’s growth record would seem to vindicate this. But critics disagree, arguing that favoured companies produce little innovation. The prominent airing of the Lin-Zhang debate reflects concerns as debt levels rise and the economy slows.Mr Zhang kicked things off in August with a speech on why industrial policy is “certain to fail”. The core problem, in his eyes, is the limits of human cognition. State planners may think they know which technologies will be important, but they are gambling. In the 1990s, the Chinese government spent vast sums building a television industry, only for cathode ray tubes to become outdated. Mr Zhang also worries about incentive problems. The safest choice for local officials is simply to follow the central government’s direction, but that leads to the kind of overcapacity that has plagued China’s solar-panel industry.For Mr Lin, such views are almost heretical. Much of his work has revolved around the idea that countries can succeed by promoting industries that play to their comparative advantages. Early innovators take big risks and may not be rewarded; the government needs to encourage them by building infrastructure and giving tax breaks. And because resources are limited, it should help identify which industries are most important. China, Mr Lin insists, is a model of this approach.Others have piled in to the debate, often trying to find a middle ground. Huo Deming, a leading economist, highlighted their different perspectives: Mr Zhang focuses on policy failures and Mr Lin on market failures. Li Daokui, another high-profile economist, noted the irony that government support has been critical to China’s growth, but that the best companies rarely start with state backing. An official with the National Development and Reform Commission, a central-planning agency, cryptically acknowledged the need to “adjust” industrial policies in line with China’s more challenging economic backdrop.Mr Zhang and Mr Lin, for their part, are not about to declare a truce. Peking University has scheduled a one-on-one debate between them on November 9th. It should be a lusty, though good-natured, clash. And if Keynes and Hayek are any guide, the dust will never settle on it.From the print edition: Finance and economics",
